  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Product Overview</h2>
    <p>As the saying goes, "Necessity is the mother of invention." The concept for the mobile lift containment system originated from a significant project known as "Project Mustang," the largest manufacturing plant of its kind globally, located east of the Denver metro area, near Denver International Airport. Due to several delays, the steel girders were exposed to the elements for eight months, enduring one of Colorado's worst rain seasons in decades. Thousands of these metal structures, intended to support the roofing system, remained in mud, snow, and sun before installation. We observed some deterioration in the primer coating of these units, manifested as peeling and cracking. Given that these units were to be installed over food and beverage manufacturing lines, future peeling was unacceptable. Over time, potential flaking could lead to product contamination.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <h3>Market gap:</h3>
    <p>Before this invention, significant man hours were spent covering and tarping equipment below spray areas, including new concrete. Additional time was required to remove these coverings.</p>
    <h3>Customers:</h3>
    <p>United Rentals, Sunbelt, and Sunstate had many rental lifts on site. Despite efforts to protect them, these units often ended up covered in paint due to extensive painting activities.</p>
    <h3>Financials:</h3>
    <p>Several rental units were deemed total losses by insurance adjustors because of the paint and debris throughout the machines. One unit alone resulted in a settlement claim of $65,000.</p>
    <h3>Costs:</h3>
    <p>Using Mobile Containment devices, painting companies saved on man hours for preparation and cleanup while maintaining the condition of returned rental units.</p>
    <h3>Usability:</h3>
    <p>PCS Unlimited developed a universal product compatible with various lift systems. It is designed for multiple brands of scissor lifts and boom lifts, and can be easily modified by one person from inside the basket in a short amount of time.</p>
